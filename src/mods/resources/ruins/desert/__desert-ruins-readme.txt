To use these templates, put them in the following Minecraft installation folder (exact path may vary depending upon your installation):

DESERT:
This is a work-in-progress collection of desert-themed ruins and buildings, including a couple of mini-dungeons and even a complete walled village with customized traders.  Before including on a multiplayer server, I recommend going into Creative mode in a "test" world and spawning these via /testruin to make sure that there isn't anything that would break the mood (or the economy!) of your world.  (I've attempted to make villager trades in keeping with existing trades, or go in a direction that doesn't compete with existing precedent, but some of them probably err on the side of being too generous.)

Known Issues: Some plants, signs, and doors will "pop" upon spawning.  

Also, despite setting some structures (such as the desert mini village) "unique=1" they seem to be popping up in quantity anyway, within the same biome.
