To use these templates, put them in the following Minecraft installation folder (exact path may vary depending upon your installation):

*\.minecraft\mods\resources\ruins\ocean

OCEAN:
This is a work-in-progress collection of structures (ruined, abandoned, or in fairly decent shape) to be found mostly in ocean biomes (though with the biomesToSpawnIn setting left as-is, they may pop up elsewhere as well).  Quite a number of them are meant to be submerged, so that your ocean isn't overly littered with life rafts and sailing ships -- but if you still have a problem with that, try increasing the Weight value of some of the "sunken" templates.
